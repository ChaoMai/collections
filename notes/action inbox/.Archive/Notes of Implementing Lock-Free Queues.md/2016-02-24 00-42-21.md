# Notes of Implementing Lock-Free Queues

# Linearizability

Linearizability implies that each operation appears to take place instantaneously at some point in time, and that **the relative order of non-concurrent operations** is perserved. In other words, for operations that are not concurrent, that data structure behaves exactly like its sequential counterpart.

# Linked List implementation

Dummy node is used,

* Avoid problems when the queue is empty or contains only one item,
* Avoid contention between enqueue and dequeue when there is only one item.

## Enqueue

* Link a new node to the end of the list,
    * If cas failed, update tail pointer.
* Change the tail pointer to the item just enqueued.

## Dequeue
