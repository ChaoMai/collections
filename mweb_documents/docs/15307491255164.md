## read mysql output to array
```bash

get_file_schema_enabled()
{
    export MYSQL_PWD=$mysql_write_pwd

    sql="
    select concat(access_key, '_', session_id)
    from data_manager_files_meta
    where has_schema = 1
    "

    ret_array=''
    while read line
    do
        ret_array+=$line,
    done < <($mysql_write -N -e "$sql")

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]
    then
        fatallog "error occors when get file schema enabled file from mysql"
        return $DB_ERROR
    fi

    echo ${ret_array[@]}
}

files=($(get_file_schema_enabled))
IFS=',' read -r -a f <<< "$files"

for idx in "${!f[@]}"
do
    echo ${f[idx]}
done
```

## while按行读取
### 读取文件
```bash
while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]];
do
    echo "Text read from file: $line"
done < "$1"
```

### 读取命令输出
```bash
while ...;
do
done < <(command)
```

`< <( )`是[Process Substitution](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessSubstitution), `$()`是[command substitution](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_03)。

## date
### format unix timestampe
```bash
date -d @1540192289 "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
```

## find
### 特定日期之前的文件
可以使用参数`newerXY`，并配合`not`来实现，但并非所有版本的`find`都支持。

```
-newerXY reference
              Compares the timestamp of the current file with reference.  The reference argument is normally the name of a file (and one of its timestamps is used for the comparison) but it
              may  also  be a string describing an absolute time.  X and Y are placeholders for other letters, and these letters select which time belonging to how reference is used for the
              comparison.

              a   The access time of the file reference
              B   The birth time of the file reference
              c   The inode status change time of reference
              m   The modification time of the file reference
              t   reference is interpreted directly as a time

              Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for X to be t.  Some combinations are not implemented on all systems; for example B is not supported on all  systems.
              If  an invalid or unsupported combination of XY is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are interpreted as for the argument to the -d option of GNU date.  If
              you try to use the birth time of a reference file, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal error message results.  If you specify a test which  refers  to  the  birth
              time of files being examined, this test will fail for any files where the birth time is unknown.
```

```bash
find -newermt "mar 03, 2010" -ls
find -newermt yesterday -ls
find -newermt "mar 03, 2010 09:00" -not -newermt "mar 11, 2010" -ls
```
