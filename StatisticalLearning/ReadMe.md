# Statistical learning

These are exercises of statistical learning class.

Most codes are based on algorithms in the 《统计学习方法》。

# Things included

## Algorithms

* Perceptron
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree(ID3, C4.5)
* Logistic Regression(Based on Logistic Regression in the Machine Learning on Coursera)

## Feature location

A class simple project.

The words used in source codes should have some relationships with the features provided by the program. This is the intuition.

I used tf-idf, svd, k-means to implement it and wrote codes in ipython.

# Programming environment

* Python 3.4.2
* matplotlib 1.4.3
* numpy 1.9.2
* scipy 0.15.1
* ipython 3.2.1
